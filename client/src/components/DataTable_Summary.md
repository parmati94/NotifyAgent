# UI Standardization Summary - DataTable Component

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of a standardized DataTable component across the NotifyAgent application, replacing multiple custom table implementations with a single, reusable component.

## Changes Made

### New Component Created:
- `DataTable.js` - A flexible, reusable table component with consistent styling and functionality

### Implementations:
1. **WebhookForm**: 
   - Replaced WebhookTable with DataTable
   - Added features: searching, sorting, customizable columns
   - Improved styling with consistent theming

2. **EmailForm**:
   - Replaced EmailTable with DataTable
   - Enhanced with search capabilities and improved empty state handling
   - Consistent appearance with other tables

3. **MessageHistoryForm**:
   - Replaced MessageHistoryTable with DataTable
   - Added template saving functionality
   - Improved display of message content with ellipsis

4. **TemplateForm**:
   - Replaced embedded table with DataTable component
   - Added template editing functionality
   - Enhanced UI with icon indicators

### Deprecated Components:
The following components were moved to `/components/deprecated_tables/` and are no longer in use:
- EmailTable.js
- WebhookTable.js
- MessageHistoryTable.js

## Benefits of Standardization

1. **Consistency**: All tables now have the same look and feel throughout the application
2. **Reusability**: New tables can be quickly created using the DataTable component
3. **Maintainability**: Changes to table behavior only need to be made in one place
4. **Enhanced Features**: All tables now benefit from:
   - Built-in search
   - Consistent sorting
   - Configurable pagination
   - Responsive layout
   - Custom rendering capabilities
   - Empty state handling

## Documentation
- Added comprehensive documentation for the DataTable component in the README.md file
- Included code examples showing how to use the component

## Future Considerations
- Consider implementing data fetching capabilities in the DataTable component
- Add exportable features (CSV, Excel, etc.)
- Implement row selection functionality
- Add drag-and-drop column reordering
